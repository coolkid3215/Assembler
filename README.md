# Assembler

This is a two phase assembler I made in my advanced microcontroller software class. It takes ".s43"assembly code and creates a list file for it. The list file contains the address in memory for each instruction, as well as the hexadecimal encoding for operations. The program does error checks for duplicates and errors in label names.
